# Sand Dancer

Aaron A. Reed's book [Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform
7](http://inform7.textories.com) largely consists of exercises that guide an
author through creating a personal copy of Sand Dancer.  Danya D. Smith
authored this version in 2023 using the most recent version of [Inform
7](https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/).  (10.1.2).

It has been over ten years since the first edition of Reedâ€™s book was published
in 2010. In the intervening years, Inform has continued to evolve. While much
of the language's syntax remains the same, there have been changes that render
some source text obsolete. The evolution and deprecation of extensions popular
at the time of publication create additional hurdles for readers working
through the book while attempting to use the most current version of Inform.
