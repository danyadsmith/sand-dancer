# The Concept Document

The story begins with a crash: waking up behind the wheel of a pickup careening out of control. You've come to a stop having driven off the road into the desert night of the American southwest: lonely and cold. Fuel dribbles from the punctured gas tank and the tracks behind the truck disappear into pitch blackness. The highway is nowhere in sight. An electrical tower and an abandoned utility building are the only signs of civilization within the range of the truck's dying headlights.

You explore the desert around the tower. Distant coyotes howl, hares flee from the fading headlights of the truck, and little dun-colored lizards (sand dancers, grandmother used to call them) scurry through the sand. Storm clouds cover the moonless sky, and the desert is pitch black outside the light. You find a flashlight and poke through the abandoned interior of the tower's utility building. As you explore, things uncovered trigger memories bubbling under the surface, traumatic events which appear in your "emotional baggage."

Through these memories,  you learn that your character is Nakaibito Galvano ("Knock"), a high school dropout working two jobs with a girlfriend on the reservation 40 miles away. The conflicting mythologies of your white hippie grandmother, Mexican stepfather, and absent Native American dad overlay these memories: stories of three spirit animals watching over you, dreams for the future, and the grimness of your present. You were on a midnight drive home from work to see your girlfriend, having made an important decision when you dozed off and drove off the road. The decision, its nature still unclear to the player, weighs heavily on Knock's mind.

In one room of the utility building is an old shortwave radio. On it, you raise a BLM ranger with a strangely familiar void who gives you two options: try to fix the truck and get back to your girlfriend, or camp out at the station for the night and wait for help to come in the morning. Indeed, items around the building could move you toward either goal, but Knock does not have the strength or courage to retrieve them.

But the open desert seems to call, whispers of sand skidding through sage. Once you've spoken with the voice on the radio and lit up the building by activating the emergency lights, you can chase a skittish hare into the desert until you stumble over a root and fall into a half-hidden burrow. Awakening, you discover you are not alone.

In the burrow is the rabbit, one of Knock's spirit guardians. His huge black eyes glint in the dim light; his lightning-fast heartbeat fills the room. The rabbit is a strange mixture of Native American folklore and 21st-century cynicism: some of the aphorisms he spouts are from Family Guy. The rabbit offers to trade one of his talents, strength, or courage, for one of the troubled memories you've uncovered. After you choose, he vanishes, but not before reminding you two other spirit animals are watching you. As you regain your senses, stumbling groggily back towards the tower, rain begins to fall.

With the help of your chosen talent, you can advance towards one goal: camping out or fixing the truck. The goals begin to take on a larger importance: trying to get home tonight would reaffirm a commitment to Knock's girlfriend, while staying the night suggests that Knock needs to make time for himself instead.

But the building seems different now, subtly changed. The voice on the radio seems to know more than it should, the crackling static like the hissing of sand. The voice asks if you know who you really are, taunts you, and threatens you. Knock finally realizes why it sounds so familiar: it is his own voice.

If Knock is unsure what to do, the player can try smoking a cigarette to solve the problem. This quickly becomes a slippery slope: the more the player smokes, the more likely Knock is to smoke by himself without the player requesting it, weakening his resolve to quit.

Shortly after acquiring a goal item, the storm clears up, and the desert calls you again. Deep in the sand, you meet the next spirit animal: the Coyote, sneakier and less comforting than the rabbit. He preaches freedom and looking out for yourself before anyone else and also forces Knock to confront the hard truth he's been trying to keep from thinking about all night: his girlfriend is pregnant. Though there's no money to start a family, she wants to keep the baby.

The Coyote offers another choice of talents, costing two memories: luck or scent. He, too vanishes, but not before warning that the last spirit animal is the most dangerous.

Using the Coyote's power brings you even closer to your chosen goal. But as you do so, the ground begins to shake. Sand pours in through the window of the building, and you must flee to the roof, where the final spirit animal is waiting: an enormous lizard, Sand-dancer himself. As he speaks, dangerous and sinister, millions of tiny lizards scurry through the desert around the tower, leaving intricately elaborate patterns in the sand.

Sand-dancer lays out the truth behind your choice. For three memories, he offers you one of two talents: honor, with which you can fix your truck and return home to your girlfriend, committing to a life together; or spirit, choosing the freedom of the open road, abandoning her and your roots for a life on your own.

But Sand-dancer smiles. There is another choice, he tells you. If you give up all your memories to him, you can buy freedom, the most powerful gift. With it, you can remake the world so that the baby was never conceived, and erase it from the past, the present, and the future. There will be no problem to solve, no hardship to suffer. His raspy tongue snakes out, and the lizards below writhe, waiting for your decision.

Each choice provides a unique conclusion to Knock's story. It's up to the player to decide which one is right.
