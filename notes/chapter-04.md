# Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform 7

## Notes on _Chapter 04 - Describing the Story World_

This chapter introduces the syntax required to:

* Describe rooms and things in the story world
* Configure scenery and backdrops
* Use bracket notation 
* Configure the initial appearance of a room or kind
* Use various text substitutions including number of and list of
* Randomize text substitutions
* Add conditional descriptions
* Define new adjectives
* Install and test extensions

### Lessons Learned

* A bracketed keyword using BENT negates initial appearance descriptions. In other words, if you mention a keyword in bracketed text in a room description, then later give that item an initial appearance description, it will not display the first time you encounter the item in the story world.
* The `New Extensions Project...` menu item includes a submenu titled `Create from Installed Extension` which can be used to run the tests included in extension documentation
