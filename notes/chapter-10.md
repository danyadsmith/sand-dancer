# Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform 7

## Notes on _Chapter 10 - Challenging Assumptions_

This chapter introduces the syntax required to:

* Change the command prompt: `now the command prompt is: __`
* Customize the status line:
  * `now the left hand status line is “Heading: [value]”`
  * `now the right hand status line is “Heading: [value]”`
* Create custom directions: `___ is a direction`
* Handle plural objects and kinds
* Handle indistinguishable objects
* Create games in other languages
* Use special characters in source text
* Prevent use of the `UNDO` command:
  * `Use undo prevention`
* Increase the game object limit:
  * `Use MAX_OBJECTS of 1000.`
* Create and alter Activity Rulebooks
* Supply a missing noun
* Print banner text
* Describe several objects simulaneously using `for writing a paragraph about`
  

### Lessons Learned

* The `VERSION` command is an action out of world that displays bibliographic data and other information about the story format
* Visible objects are `unmentioned` before the room description process and switch to `mentioned` when described
