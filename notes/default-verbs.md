# Default Verbs in Inform

> Every time the player types a command, the parser tries to match it to one of the actions your story knows about. We always refer to Inform’s actions in the gerund form (ending in “ing”): so the player command `EXAMINE THE FLASHLIGHT` becomes the Inform action _”examining the flashlight”_.
