# Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform 7

## Notes on _Chapter 02 - Introducing the Inform Application_

Much of this chapter focuses on installing the Inform 7 IDE and reviewing its features. According to the text, the software can be downloaded by visitng [http://inform7.com](https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/) but this URL currently redirects to [https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/](https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/) and the site is a shell of the version available at the time this book was published.

I prefer to download the application from [the official GitHub repository for the macOS version of the IDE](https://github.com/TobyLobster/Inform). I found that it provides the most recent release while the official Inform 7 Downloads page was behind a version or two.

Most of the screenshots in this chapter are out-of-date, but the general layout of the IDE has not changed much since this book was published.

### The Source Panel

The most important highlight in this chapter describes the sectioning keywords you use to create headings in source text:

> Headings must be their own paragraphs (with blank lines before and after) and begin with a heading word (in ranked order, they are `Volume`, `Book`, `Part`, `Chapter`, and `Section`).
