# Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform 7

## Notes on _Chapter 01 - Understanding Interactive Fiction_

### Finding and Installing an IF Interpreter

I recall using one of the recommended interpreters when I started to frequent [IFDB](https://ifdb.org) in 2012. [Zoom for macOS](https://www.logicalshift.co.uk/mac/zoom/manual/) was a nice interpreter for beginners. It allowed you to organize your library and included an embedded search engine for IFDB.

Currently, my favorite interpreter for macOS is [Spatterlight](https://github.com/angstsmurf/spatterlight).  [IfWiki](https://www.ifwiki.org) provides [a list of recommended interpreters](https://www.ifwiki.org/Recommended_interpreters) worth reviewing for newcomers to the IF community.

One of my highlights in this chapter discussed the difference between **z-code** and **Glulx** story files:

> **z-code story files** are best for small or medium stories. They do not offer advanced style or multimedia capabilities. Z-code story files typically end with the extensions `.z5`, `.z8`, or `.zblorb`.

> **Glulx story files** are best for long stories or those which need advanced style and multimedia effects. Glulx stories typically end with the file extensions `.ulx` or `.gblorb`.

It is important to note that the current version of Inform 7 sets the default story file format to `Glulx`.


### Playing IF

#### Command Prompt and Syntax

> Any valid IF command does one of three things:
> 1. **Observation**: Returns information passively about the state of the world.
> **2. Action**: Causes a change in the state of the world.
> **3. Action Out of World**: Performs a “meta-action” on the program running the story world, not the story world itself.

Following the above highlight, the text lists a number of example actions. The [How to Play Interactive Fiction](http://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/) postcard published by the [people’s republic of interactive fiction](http://pr-if.org) expands on the list and is a great beginner’s resource.

### Story vs. Game

This was my most highlighted section of this chapter. In it, Reed attempts to debunk a common perception:

> The belief that games and stories are fundamentally imcompatible is surprisingly common.

### The Concept Document

The chapter ends with an introduction to Sand-dancer: The Example Game by introducing its design document (a.k.a, [The Concept Document](./concept-document.md)).
