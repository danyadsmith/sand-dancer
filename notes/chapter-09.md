# Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform 7

## Notes on _Chapter 09 - Creating Characters_

This chapter introduces the syntax required to:

* Create characters using the `person` designation with more specificity using:
  * `male person` or `man` to refer to the character with male pronouns
  * `female person` of `woman` to refer to the character with female pronouns
  * `neuter person` to refer to the character with gender-neutral pronouns
* Create characters using the `animal` designation
* Describe characters and the things they carry or wear

### Lessons Learned

* A **puppet** (or, completely generic PC):
  * Obeys all commands
  * Has an unspecified gender and age
* A **role** (or, completely detailed PC):
  * May know things the player doesn’t know
  * May be ignorant of facts the player knows
  * May refuse to take an action
* With a **puppet**, the game proceeds via puppetry (player exploration)
* With a **role**, the game proceess via character acting and role-playing
* The **viewpoint character** is the one from whose point of viiew the story is told.
* The **viewpoint character** may or may not be the PC
* Stories can have multiple player characters
* Many of Inform’s built-in actions are just bare-bones definitions, or **stubs**
* Inform offer a handy **pathfinding** tool that will help move NPCs through the story world

### Quotes from the Text

No. 1: 

> A blank-state character is sometimes called a **puppet**, and a fully-realized one a **role**: the term implies how this difference in characterization affects the experience of play.
